        <element class="questions">You started this show only a couple weeks ago, what was it like to conceptualize and bring this show to life?
        </element>
        <p>RENNY: I think that it was really just finding a genre or type of music that I really liked, and then finding out other people really liked it too and wanting to put it on the radio. It was also finding something so online and digital and putting
            it on such an ‘analog’ medium. RENNY: In terms of actually starting the show, it was actually Reggie [who inspired me], I followed them on twitter, saw that they did Mountain Breeze, and then was like “What if I did a hyperpop specialty show?”.
            I didn’t think it was achievable until I actually spoke to people at WREK, and then I did the Sunday Special and I got a lot of really good feedback. Then I was like, ok, I’ll make this a speciality show. I was also worried about not having
            enough material, but I’m constantly finding new stuff so It hasn’t been an issue.
        </p>
        <element class="questions">How would you describe 100 Wrek’s sound?</element>
        <p>RENNY: I’d say that it’s very maximalist and digital. That’s the best two ways to describe it. It’s definitely computer music.
