    <h1>.。･:*:･100 Wreks･:*:･。.</h1>
    <p>Interview with Renny (they/them), the host of our newest hyperpop and digicore show 100 Wreks! They recently began the show on November 13th, 2021.

    <element class="questions">You started this show only a couple weeks ago, what was it like to conceptualize and bring this show to life?
    </element>
    <p>RENNY: I think that it was really just finding a genre or type of music that I really liked, and then finding out other people really liked it too and wanting to put it on the radio. It was also finding something so online and digital and putting
        it on such an ‘analog’ medium. <br>RENNY: In terms of actually starting the show, it was actually Reggie [who inspired me], I followed them on twitter, saw that they did Mountain Breeze, and then was like “What if I did a hyperpop specialty show?”.
        I didn’t think it was achievable until I actually spoke to people at WREK, and then I did the Sunday Special and I got a lot of really good feedback. Then I was like, ok, I’ll make this a speciality show. I was also worried about not having enough
        material, but I’m constantly finding new stuff so It hasn’t been an issue.

    <element class="questions">How would you describe 100 Wrek’s sound?</element>
    <p>RENNY: I’d say that it’s very maximalist and digital. That’s the best two ways to describe it. It’s definitely computer music.
    </p>
    <element class="questions">What do you think are the essentials of hyperpop? Like defining albums or artists that pioneered the genre?
    </element>
    <p>RENNY: I think as far as pioneering the genre, you have to pay respect to SOPHIE. Her work was really what paved the way for what hyperpop is today. As far as essentials right now, Fraxiom and dltzk are two that come to mind that are really pushing
        the genre forward and defining the sound. There’s so much good stuff that it’s hard to have one answer.
    </p>
    <element class="questions">What are your personal favorite albums/songs that you want to feature on the show?</element>
    <p>RENNY: One of my absolute favorites that I might feature this Saturday [November 20th] is “1” by Petal Supply. It’s like a 12 minute long maximalist soundscape. There are four different artists on it that have different sections, but it’s pretty incredible!
        It’s one of my favorite releases this year.</p>
    <element class="questions">Do you think that the reason why hyperpop is so popular right now is that there is such a low barrier to entry to create it?
    </element>
    <p>RENNY: Because of this music age we’re in, it’s so easy to get free or pirated audio production software, so anyone can get into music that wants to. You have all of youtube, twitter and discord to learn. underscores is a really cool artist that recorded
        their most recent album’s vocals on an iphone mic. Kmoe has a $30-50 mic that he does all of his vocals on. You don’t need big studios to be successful in this space, so I think that it allows for much younger artists and a wider variety of perspectives
        to get into it.
    </p>
    <element class="questions">Where do you see the hyperpop/digicore genre heading into the future?</element>
    <p>RENNY: Honestly I don’t think it’s as much a genre as it is more a movement and a community. I definitely see the attitudes of hyperpop (diy music and anti-establishment themes) heading into different musical influences. Like dltzk’s album would be
        hard defined as ‘hyperpop’ because it’s ‘noise rock’ almost, but to someone who knows the movement it is very aligned with hyperpop. I think that hyperpop in new genres and spaces is what we’re going to see next.</p>
    <element class="questions">What are some adjacent genres that you want to feature on your show?</element>
    <p>RENNY: Definitely nightcore. Which obviously has its own things about being called a genre since it’s just sped up and pitched up songs, but it’s a precursor to hyperpop, so I think it’s appropriate. RENNY: I think hyperpop shares a lot with indie
        rock because of its low barrier to entry. I think indie rock is kind of like a teenager with a guitar and hyperpop is just like a teenager with a computer. I think that a lot of artists that started out doing computer music, like stereotypical
        hyperpop, have more recently gone into ‘indie rock’ directions. I also think that hyperpop is kind of a playground for young artists to explore all the genres they want. You can get a hyperpop album from a 17 year old that features so many different
        genres like metal, rock, electronic. And people will still listen to it!
    </p>
    <element class="questions">Where do you usually find the music for your show?</element>
    <p>RENNY: Soundcloud. Like definitive answer, because anyone can create a free account and find music on there. You can find a ton of stuff not on streaming platforms because it’s not monetized [and easier to add your own production]. You can also find
        older and rarer songs because anyone can upload and share music there.</p>
    <element class="questions">What plans do you have for the show in the future?</element>
    <p>RENNY: I have a lot of really fun special-themed shows in mind. I’m going to do a SOPHIE tribute in January, when she passed away. I’m going to do a hyper-holiday show of course. I also think there are a lot of covers and remixes that don’t get enough
        attention because they are covers and remixes, I’d love to highlight reworkings of songs. I’d also love to do an end-of-year album review.</p>
    <element class="questions">What other kinds of music do you listen to outside of your show?</element>
    <p>RENNY: I listen to everything. I listen to a lot of Mitski, I will say. I am a fan of Crush.</p>
    <element class="questions">Now for the big question. Is Drain Gang hyperpop????</element>
    <p>RENNY: Absolutely. 100%. The members of drain gang are not necessarily in the same communities that you would find other hyperpop artists, but their music is what inspired most of the people in this community. I think it would be so foolish to not
        call them hyperpop or to not suggest it.</p>
    <element class="questions">Have you had any interactions with any of the artists you’ve played on the show?</element>
    <p>RENNY: Obviously it was before I started the show, but I've interacted with a lot of the artists I’ve played on the show on twitter. A lot of them are really underground, so It’s not like they have millions of followers. Especially since I make mashups,
        the artists that I play will sometimes comment on them which is pretty fun. I’m hoping at some point I can get some of them to listen to the show. I’ve interacted with Petal Supply, and underscores commented on my mashup of one of their songs,
        which was pretty crazy. </p>
    <element class="questions">What is your relationship with the genre as someone who produces mixes?</element>
    <p>RENNY: The only reason I mix is because of the genre. Seeing that anyone can get started with producing I was like, Wow! Anyone can get into producing. It’s kind of infectious. Seeing all these artists post things about their production, you get a
        window into how these things are done, which is really fun.</p>
    <p>You can tune into 100 Wreks every Saturday from 6-7pm on WREK Atlanta 91.1 FM!!</p>
