    <element class="questions">Girl rock is constantly highlighting new genres from week to week, but overall how would you describe the show’s sound?
    </element>
    <p>ELIZABETH: Overarching, I would say that it’s indie. Like mainly indie rock and indie pop. Right now though, we’re taking it in more of an explorative direction. <br>LYDIA: It started off as the riot grrrl and punk show, but through the years it’s
        expanded. Now we try to highlight women in every genre. We’re taking the show to maximize and highlight female artists in a variety of different genres. <br>KARINA: I think I would say that we try to showcase prominent female voices who are generally
        underrepresented in their respective genres. So when we’re not doing a themed episode, it’s more on the indie rock and indie pop side. I’ll say that we try to throw in a few punk and rock songs in there on the regular.
    </p>
    <element class="questions">What are a couple albums/songs that you think embody your show? Or just favorites you guys have discovered through the show?
    </element>
    <p>KARINA: I have a playlist actually. These don’t necessarily capture the girl rock sound, but here are some albums I’ve found when looking for music for Girl Rock: Die 4 Your Love by Tei Shi, Mythopoetics by Half Waif, Itekomoa Hits by Otoboke Beaver.
        <br>ELIZABETH: We play a lot of Muna. They’re really great. They’re a trio that produces all of their own stuff. We’re trying to move into highlighting more female instrumentalists. Not just female singers! <br>LYDIA: There are so many different
        ways to be involved in the music process than singing.
    </p>
    <element class="questions">Girl Rock is a show with a lot of history, how would you describe how it’s changed throughout the years?
    </element>
    <p>KARINA: It’s definitely become less riot grrl and I think we’ve ventured into a ‘softer sound’. <br>LYDIA: It started out as the Riot Grrl show. Each host has kind of expanded it, I think that we have the most broad interpretation of it. We’re more
        exploratory and have ventured into what being a female/non-binary artist in rock and music prodution is like.

    <element class="questions">Have you had any interactions with any artists you guys play on the show?
    </element>
    <p>ELIZABETH: Our recent collaboration with the host of Crush generated some buzz! <a href="https://twitter.com/Death_Hags/status/1456314587498917888?s=20">One of our artists reached out to us on twitter.</a> Recently we also talked with Password:Password
        who knew that we played them on the show! <br>LYDIA: One of the indigo girls posed with our merch! we’re huge fans of them and we play them all the time. ​​
    </p>
    <element class="questions">What plans do you have for the show in the future?</element>
    <p>LYDIA: Continue with the direction we’re going, while also staying true to our roots. <br>ELIZABETH: I’d like to see us highlighting more female producers and instrumentalists. We also have an international series coming soon! <br>KARINA: I would
        really like to bring more diversity into the show, because I’m the only host of color so I feel like its my responsibility to highlight women and nonbinary artists of color; This is why we’re doing the international series.

    <element class="questions">Where do you usually find the music for your show?
    </element>
    <p>LYDIA: I’m constantly looking for new stuff, through labels and spotify discover. I have a big playlist where I keep all the songs I like that feature women. <br>ELIZABETH: First off, when i’m auditioning a CD for wrek, In the back of my mind I’m
        always thinking “could this be in girl rock?”. Sometimes we’re doing genres I'm not as well versed in, so I find band camp’s explore feature awesome! You can sort your music by the genre, and it’s the artist self-selecting their genre. A lot of
        the time it’s really underground stuff you wouldn’t be able to find otherwise.
    </p>
    <element class="questions">What is it like having four hosts, how do you guys collaborate on episodes?
    </element>
    <p>KARINA: We pretty much just drop our songs into one playlist, and Elizabeth goes into the playlist and sorts them sonically. I think that we’ve noticed that each of us have a sound that we gravitate towards, so sometimes it’s fun to guess who added
        which song.
